# Final Changes

After receiving feedback on my piece, I made a lot of changes. Firstly I completely flipped the flow of the piece by making the cloud run left to right instead of right to left. This changed the perspective from one of the cloud coming out of the computer to one of the cloud being funnelled into it. I also changed the colors of the clouds, the external one with the creative objects is now grayscale to represent them not being used or expressed, and the rainbow speading out to the computer is now representing the flow of creativity from the persons thoughts into some action. I changed the background color so that the thought cloud would flow into the background and also contrast with the objects and the text better. I changed the text color to a more complimentary purple to the now yellow cloud. The cloud stands out amongst the black and attempts to focus your attention on the vertex between the two clouds (also known as the person's head). I removed the "head flaps" because it was perceived as an analogy for a bullet through the head which I had never considered.
