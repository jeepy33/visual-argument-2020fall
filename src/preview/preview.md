# Preview Progress
So far I've drafted two ideas in my sketchbook. Then after some playing with the designs in illustrator I decided to select my head cloud image to pursue. I started by tracing the sketch with a black brush. Then once the outline was done I made a layer below the outlines to color in the shapes using the brush tool. After coloring the original outline, I made a layer on top to add details like the head flaps and erased and added things so thatthe computer screen lines went into the head not just arrived at it. I then found some text that I believed conveyed my message that creativity is good to express and think about. And added some colored boxes with the rectangle tool to create a bounding box for the piece. After a few pink clouds on a new bottom layer, I stopped working on this preview and for the draft I plan to add a collage of images into the rainbow cloud that represent creativity.
